<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a school project to practice doing projects, sick! We are making a game featuring geese as we thought this was fun.

The game is not planned yet but we envision the following features to start with:
* Flying goose with fun inuitive flight controls
* Big world map to explore and interact with
* Things on the ground to interact with, i.e. other animals perhaps
* Picking up and dropping garden gnomes, they also explode. Fun!
* Multiplayer so you can play with friends

The group consist of:
* Jack "War Goose" Forsberg
* Andreas "Multiplayer Goose" Rödin
* Johannes "The Goose" Widén
* Noah "Mesh Goose" Mandegård
* Elias "Nowhere to be found Goose" Uddin
